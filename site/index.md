Aroma is game creation framework/platform that targets both [Chrome's Native
Client][1] and desktops. It lets you run your games in the browser with Chrome
or distribute it as a standalone executable on Linux, Windows and OSX.

Aroma games are written in the [Lua][2] programming language. Aroma implements
parts of the [LÃ–VE][3] Lua API, so if you've got a game already written it's
easy to port.
